#Rubik's Cube Game

A simple Rubik's Cube game writen in MatLab. To run you will need ...Matlab. The main file is RubikGUI.m.

I have not attempted to play for quite some time and cannot guarantee that the game works on current (or any) versions of MatLab. If you are interested in running the program and have trouble please let me know and I'll help as best I can.

Thanks,
