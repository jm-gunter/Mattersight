# Project Euler Solutions

Euler is my 2nd favorite mathematician (after Galois) and these are some solutions to the Euler Project problems.
I started working through these as a way to learn Python and have some fun at the same time. After some debate, I 
made them public mostly so that I could reference them easily. If you came here looking for solutions because you
are stuck then shame on you, you know you're not supposed to do that.
